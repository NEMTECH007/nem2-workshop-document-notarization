NEM provides both a decentralized, open and self-sustaining **public blockchain** that can be used by anyone â€“ as well as a **permissioned/private blockchain** solution.

You could decide whether timestamping in your own private chain when speed and privacy are the priority. But, if you want to ensure your notarization is verifiable by anyone, you could opt to use the public chain.

When notarizing documents in the public blockchain, you will have to pay a fee to sustain the network. A common approach is to anchor the hash of your private chain blocks into the public chain, ensuring the private chain is not tampered.
